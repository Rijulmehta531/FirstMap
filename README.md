Directions to test the project:
1. Once you run the project, you'll get directed to the map of San Fransisco. You'll see various clustered markers with numbers on them.
2. Double click to zoom in. The clustered markers will spread out into little bicycle icons. You can click on these markers to get the details of the bicycle shops, which includes its name, address and rating.
3. When you click on a specific area in which there are markers, that area will get highlighted with a purple circle.
4. When you move the map around, the icons will get a little transparent for the time being. They will become opaque once you stop moving around.
